# GHS
C++ implementation of GHS - a distributed minimum spanning tree algorithm

## Introduction
GHS is a distributed algorithm to solve classical MST problem. It was first suggested and solved in O(V \log V) time in 1983 by Gallager et al in the paper "A distributed algorithm for minimum-weight spanning trees".

This source code gives an implementation of GHS in C++ .
